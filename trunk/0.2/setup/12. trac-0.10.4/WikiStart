= Welcome to Trac 0.10.4 =

Trac is a '''minimalistic''' approach to '''web-based''' management of
'''software projects'''. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking and handling of software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to 
'''help developers write great software''' while '''staying out of the way'''
and imposing as little as possible on a team's established process and
culture.
